# 📚 LibraryManager

**LibraryManager** is a simple command-line application written in Python that simulates a basic book rental system.  
It was one of my first object-oriented programming (OOP) projects and a valuable step in learning how to structure Python applications using classes and objects.

## 🎓 What I Learned

This project helped me understand the basics of building structured Python applications using OOP.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- 🔹 How to define and work with classes and methods  
- 🔹 Separating responsibilities between objects (e.g., `Library` vs `User`)  
- 🔹 Designing a user-friendly CLI experience  
- 🔹 Importance of naming, readability, and keeping code clean — even in small scripts

## 📌 Project Status

- ✅ **Finished** — currently complete and functional  
- 💡 **Future ideas:** I might add a simple **SQLite** database to persist books and user data
